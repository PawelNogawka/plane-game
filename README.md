# plane-game


The game comes from the "Complete JavaScript Projects Course Games 55 Modern JS DOM" course.

First, I created the game with the instructor, then from scratch by myself.

While writing the code, I learned and consolidated things like:

- requestAnimationFrame
- 2 elements collision detection
- Listening for events such as keyup and keydown and later using them in the code to control the plane
- How to generate a random color with the Math.random () method
- Creating the game field boundary thanks to methods like getBoundingClientRect () or the offset properties
- Generally working with the DOM, getting / removing items etc.
